I am a 1st-year Ph.D. student in [MMLab](https://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/) (Multimedia Laboratory), [The Chinese University of Hong Kong](https://www.cuhk.edu.hk/english/index.html), supervised by [Prof. Dahua Lin](http://dahua.site/). Before that, I obtained my Master degree from the [Department of Computer Science and Technology](https://cs.nju.edu.cn/main.htm), [Nanjing University](https://www.nju.edu.cn/EN/main.htm), supervised by [Prof. Limin Wang](http://wanglimin.github.io/). I obtained the B.Sc. degree from [Kuang Yaming Honors School](https://dii.nju.edu.cn/kym_en/main.htm), Nanjing University in 2020.

My research interests generally lie in Computer Vision and Machine Learning, with a specific focus on 3D Content Creation and Video Understanding.

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
