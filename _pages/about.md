I am a 1st-year Ph.D. student in [MMLab](https://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/) (Multimedia Laboratory), [The Chinese University of Hong Kong](https://www.cuhk.edu.hk/english/index.html), supervised by [Prof. Dahua Lin](http://dahua.site/). Before that, I obtained my Master degree from the [Department of Computer Science and Technology](https://cs.nju.edu.cn/main.htm), [Nanjing University](https://www.nju.edu.cn/EN/main.htm), supervised by [Prof. Limin Wang](http://wanglimin.github.io/). I obtained the B.Sc. degree from [Kuang Yaming Honors School](https://dii.nju.edu.cn/kym_en/main.htm), Nanjing University in 2020.

My research interests generally lie in Computer Vision and Machine Learning, with a specific focus on 3D Content Creation and Video Understanding.
